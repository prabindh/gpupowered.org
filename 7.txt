Below is some of the feedback from the GFX 2011 Workshop, held in December, from the participants:

<...>The Labs were really good, This is the best mix of the Practical and theoretical trainings

<...>The simple yet very useful to understand the openGL labs. The best thing happened was it was arranged in between theory sessions so that we can immediately link/map the understanding to practicals. Unlike most of the trainings it was not arranged at the end, for which most of the people neglect the lab sessions. 

<...>as a part of applications team we wanted to explore ways to leverage opengl. This workshop was the best opportunity to get the idea of scope and hands on experience in opengl. 

<...>Instructor knew the material and was able to answer all questions. Workshop was fully technical (no fluff).

<...>If the time could be extended for 2days. Because it was very compact.
