Introduction:
Euclid is a tool for manual labelling of data - sets, such as those found in Deep learning systems that employ Caffe. This includes systems like DIGITS.

This tool runs on Linux and Windows, and is based on Python 2.7/Tkinter. Though the UI is a bit clunky it is functional at this point.

Label format support:

The tool supports Kitti data-set output format at this time.

For the actual format, see the below link, or the Kitti dataset development kit.
