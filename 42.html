In order to be realistic and as close to the physical skin view of their natural environment, graphics rendering needs to account for what is termed as "sub-surface scattering", needed because of the physical fact that human skin is ~translucent in the upper layer. This is in addition to the usual Reflectance factors that are commonly being used. Most of the below algorithms, use a shadow map and use it for further processing.

Since hair is closely associated with skin (even small hair), it is important to see both of these together.  Some of the techniques being used today:
