C++ Port of Darknet (of YOLO fame)

OpenCV3 failures when working with C based DL frameworks, like DeepNet (Made famous by YOLO - http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) is a common issue.

Here is the latest version of Darknet, ported to C++, fixing many coding bugs along the way. Work involved primarily encapsulation of APIs with C linkages, including undefined headers, bug fixes, and typecasting various allocations to actual types, and using correct Error detection types for CUBLAS.

For training with own dataset, and detection, refer to the updated README at,
