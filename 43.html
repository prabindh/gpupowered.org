Rendering translucent materials like Glass, involves taking care of both reflection and refraction, to get realistic results. This also needs specific OpenGL functionality on render to texture, cube-maps, and different types of transformation and blending to get the final effect.

Below is a summary of the components and techniques used for rendering materials like glass and water: 

<em> OpenGL/GLSL API for reflect, refract functionality

<em>Cube-maps are commonly used for obtaining a lookup of the environment for reflection, hence an introduction to the same:

This has a good description of the workflow involved - normal terms, Fresnel factors, Reflection and Refraction.

This provides some more theoretical background on the effects involved.
