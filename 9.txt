SGX HW accelerated WebGL with Firefox14 on 3730

 Submitted by prabindh on Fri, 01/15/2016 - 20:25  / /
Introduction

This post introduces acceleration capabilities of 3730, used in smooth rendering of WebGL in Firefox14 (from mozilla-central trunk), with egl backend on Linux. Binaries and builds are provided, along with screen captures and performance information. For WebGL on Android information refer to http://gpupowered.org/node/12

Performance

It is possible to achieve upto 15 fps on below demos that have been tested with this build, rendering onto a VGA surface.

Target requirements:
4.06.xx Graphics driver package. Download from
http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/AM35x-OMAP35x_Graphics_SDK_Getti...
Firefox14 b2g package
https://gforge.ti.com/gf/download/docmanfileversion/297/5516/b2g-prabu-e...
Filesystem with atleast gcc4.5 or greater. The b2g pre-built package is built with 4.6 Linaro toolchain.

Execution on target:

Untar the below archive to target:
https://gforge.ti.com/gf/download/docmanfileversion/297/5516/b2g-prabu-e...

Set the below windowsystem mode for B2G - below are needed - b2g egl acceleration doesnt work in FRONT mode. Set in "/etc/powervr.ini" file.

[default]
#WindowSystem=libpvrPVR2D_FRONTWSEGL.so
WindowSystem=libpvrPVR2D_FLIPWSEGL.so

DisableHWTextureUpload=1 needs to be added for drivers upto 4.05.xx version. For the latest graphics package 4.06.xx this is not required.

To launch a webpage, perform below action inside the b2g-prabu folder after extraction of archive:
B2G_HOMESCREEN=http://www.examplewebgl.com ./b2g

Configuration and Building

The firefox14 b2g can be built by using below tools and sgxconfiguro.

https://github.com/prabindh/mozilla-embedded/blob/master/patches/3Apr/wh...
https://github.com/prabindh/mozilla-embedded/blob/master/patches/26Mar/0...
Crosscompile toolchain from Linaro, or other, atleast 4.5
Host machine should have atleast 2GB RAM

sgxconfiguro provides pkgconfig information for cross-compilation. This tool can be obtained from

HTML5 WebGL capabilities

Per html5test.com, Firefox14 on 3730 Linux scored 344 points, and full WebGL capabilities. This is significantly better than WebKit, where I am struggling to get Webkit recognise the GLES2 driver and create a WebGL context, though it is configured for WebGL support.
