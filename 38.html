<em>Enabling 3D Texturing support with glfw3 and GLES2

Sometimes it is required to enable 3D texture support in an OpenGLES 2.0 context. It is possible to do this, if the underlying platform supports the 3D texturing extension.

Steps:

- When using glfw3, extension headers need to be enabled in the build, through below step in header files:

#define GLFW_INCLUDE_ES2 1
#define GLFW_INCLUDE_GLEXT 1
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

- Check if the 3D texturing extension support exists in the platform, by using  glfwExtensionSupported, with the query parameter of "GL_OES_texture_3D". Note that, a common mistake is doing this check before a context is created. This can only be queried after a context is created.

- Get the extension proc address through below:

glfwGetProcAddress("glTexImage3DOES");

- Create and load the 3D textures using the proc address obtained in earlier step. Parameters for this API are explained in the below extension specification.

- Load the shaders with 3D texture lookup, similar to below:

color = texture3D(uSampler0, texcoords)

Note that uSampler0 is to be of "sampler3D" type, and the OES extension has to be enabled through use of "#extension GL_OES_texture_3D : enable" in the shader.

- Draw objects as usual
