<em>Open Shading Language (OSL)

OSL was developed by an inhouse team at Sony Imageworks, for use in its rendering pipelines for movies. It is a shader description language, built out of LLVM infrastructure.

In OSL, shaders do not calculate color output per pixel, but define a function that returns a surface, displacement, volume or define a new generic shader. Reflectance and Transmittance of surfaces are modelled as functions, or "Closures". These are evaluated during the rendering phase. From "Larry Gritz, OSL_Introduction" - OSL's surface and volume shaders compute an explicit symbolic description, called a "closure", of the way a surface or volume scatters light, in units of radiance. These radiance closures may be evaluated in particular directions, sampled to find important directions, or saved for later evaluation and re-evaluation (by component blocks called as "Integrators"). This new approach is ideal for a physically-based renderer that supports ray tracing and global illumination.

A sample surface shader looks like below:

surface
test (string noisename = "gabor", float freq = 5, output color Cout = 0)
{
   point p = P*freq * (1.0+10*v*v) * (1.0+10*u*u);
   float n = noise(noisename, p[0], p[1]);
   Cout = n * 0.5 + 0.5;
}

The most relevant purpose in the CG workflow I can think of for these type of shaders, is to be able to replicate the behaviour of pre-recorded BRDF using instruments like the Gonioreflectometer. Once recorded, these BRDFs can be replicated almost accurately in the rendered scene.

<em>Examples

How does this rendering look like really ? Some examples are to be found in chocofur.com (http://store.chocofur.com/exterior-scene-01), that look amazingly realistic.
